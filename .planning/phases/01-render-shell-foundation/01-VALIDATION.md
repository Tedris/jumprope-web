# Phase 1 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | node:test (Node built-in, `node --test`) |
| **Config file** | none — existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements |
| **Quick run command** | `node --test tests/` |
| **Full suite command** | `node --test tests/` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~5 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `node --test tests/`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `node --test tests/`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 10 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 01-01-01 | 01 | 1 | ARCH-01 | — | N/A | unit | `node --test tests/` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `tests/boundary.test.js` — import-graph walk asserting no sim/test module imports `three` (D-03)

*Planner to reconcile with final task breakdown.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Full run playable through WebGL shell (idle → running → choose → over) | ARCH-01 | Requires browser WebGL rendering | Serve static files, open page, play one full run in browser |
| Rope visuals never drift from scoring under load | ARCH-01 | Perceptual timing under frame-rate variance | Play in browser while stressing CPU; observe rope/scoring sync |

*All other phase behaviors have automated verification.*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 10s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
